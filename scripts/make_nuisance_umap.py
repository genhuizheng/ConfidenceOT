"""What sequencing depth and the low-gene effect actually do to an embedding.

The ablation reports a number called "axis vs total counts". It is the
correlation between the leading axis of the representation and each cell's
sequencing depth, and as a number it says nothing to anyone. This is the
picture it was measured on.

**Every cell here is drawn from one population.** There is no biology to find:
the cells differ only in how deeply they were sequenced, or in how many genes
were detected. So any structure that appears in the embedding is the artefact
and nothing else, and the question "is the artefact still there after the
preprocessing" is something a reader can answer by looking rather than by
trusting a correlation coefficient.

Two nuisances, and they are not the same thing.

**Sequencing depth.** Cells get different total counts -- the spread the
benchmark uses is sd(log depth) 0.9, roughly a twenty-fold range between the
shallowest and deepest cell. This is the thing most normalisations are built
to remove.

**The low-gene effect, or dropout.** Total counts are held *fixed* and the
cells differ in how many distinct genes those counts land on: the same library
concentrated in a few genes, or spread over many. Depth normalisation does not
touch this, because the totals already agree. It is the covariate the
ablation's third column was about and the one nothing in the factorial
removes.

Each row is one preprocessing. Each column colours the same embedding by one
nuisance. A gradient means the embedding is arranging cells by that nuisance;
an even mix of colours means it is not.
